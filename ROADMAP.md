# üöÄ CloudIDE+ Development Roadmap
**Building a Cloud Development Platform on VS Code Foundation**

---

## üìÖ Project Timeline: 16 Weeks
**Target**: Production-ready cloud development platform with custom VS Code extensions

---

## üéØ Project Vision
Transform the cloud development experience by building powerful extensions on top of the proven VS Code platform, rather than recreating an IDE from scratch.

### Why This Approach?
- **Faster Time to Market**: Build on proven foundation
- **Better User Experience**: Familiar VS Code interface
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to existing extensions
- **Focus on Innovation**: Spend time on unique cloud features, not basic IDE functionality

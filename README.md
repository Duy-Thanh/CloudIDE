CloudIDE+

CloudIDE+ is a powerful, browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) inspired by Visual Studio Code, built on modern cloud technologies. It provides developers with a seamless, lightweight coding experience accessible from anywhere, integrating Google Cloud services for authentication, file management, and collaboration, alongside live user support powered by Zoho SalesIQ.

Project Overview

CloudIDE+ is a cloud-hosted, full-featured web IDE aimed at delivering the familiar experience of Visual Studio Code directly in the browser without any local setup. Leveraging Google Cloud Compute Engine for backend infrastructure and multiple Google APIs for user management and data persistence, the platform targets developers needing an accessible, secure, and scalable coding environment.

By integrating Zoho SalesIQ, CloudIDE+ provides real-time live chat support and visitor analytics, enhancing user engagement and support capabilities within the IDE itself.
